# SDL Game/Game Engine

## Description
This is a personal project of mine I'm doing for fun. I'm trying to make a game engine in the hopes of being able to create 
a game with it at some point. At the moment it is a 2d top down game. 

## Language
The primary language I am writing this in is CPP. I am using the SDL2 library to assist with I/O.

## Comment Format
To make functions easier to understand, a common comment format is used for each one.  
/**  
 \* Function Description  
 \*  
 \* @param paramName - Parameter Description  
 \*  
 \* @return Return Description  
 */
