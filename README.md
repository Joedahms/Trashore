# SDL Game/Game Engine

## Description
This is a personal project of mine I'm doing for fun. I'm trying to make a game engine in the hopes of being able to create 
a game with it at some point. At the moment it is a 2d top down game. 

## Language
The primary language I am writing this in is CPP. I am using the SDL2 library to assist with I/O.

## Dependencies
libsdl2-image-dev
libsdl2-ttf-dev
