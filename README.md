# SDL Game/Game Engine

## Description

This is a personal project of mine I'm doing for fun. I'm trying to make a game engine in the hopes of being able to
create
a game with it at some point. At the moment it is a 2d top down game.

## Language

The primary language I am writing this in is CPP. I am using the SDL2 library for graphics and I/O.

## Comment Format

At the moment I am using Javadoc comments for methods that may need them. This is on a method to method basis.

## Dependencies

libsdl2-image-dev
libsdl2-ttf-dev

## How to Run

- Change to the build directory
- $ cmake ..
- $ make
- $ ./sdlGameEngine
